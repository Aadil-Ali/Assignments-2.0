    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, provide insights into the spread or variability of data points within a dataset. They help quantify how much the data values deviate from the central tendency (e.g., mean or median). Let's explore how these measures are used to describe the spread of a dataset with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Exam Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a teacher and you have collected the exam scores (out of 100) of a group of students in your class. The scores are as follows: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 76, 95, 82, 89, 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - Range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "   - Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value\n",
    "   - Range = 95 - 76 = 19\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance**:\n",
    "   - Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean: (85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88 + 76 + 95 + 82 + 89 + 85) / 10 = 85.2\n",
    "   - Calculate the squared deviations from the mean for each score: (85 - 85.2)^2, (90 - 85.2)^2, ...\n",
    "   - Sum the squared deviations: Sum = (0.04 + 20.25 + 134.56 + 41.64 + 6.44 + 72.36 + 82.01 + 7.84 + 13.69 + 0.04) = 378.23\n",
    "   - Variance = Sum / (n - 1) = 378.23 / 9 ≈ 42.03\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "   - Standard Deviation = √Variance ≈ √42.03 ≈ 6.48\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The range of exam scores is 19, indicating that the scores vary by this amount from the lowest to the highest.\n",
    "- The variance is approximately 42.03, showing the average squared deviation of scores from the mean.\n",
    "- The standard deviation is approximately 6.48, representing the typical (average) deviation of scores from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance and standard deviation provide a more precise description of how spread out the scores are compared to the range. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the scores, while a lower standard deviation suggests less variability. These measures help you understand the distribution and variability of the exam scores, providing valuable insights for educational assessment and decision-making.\n"
